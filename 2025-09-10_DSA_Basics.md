## Physical Data Structures
These define **how data is arranged in memory** during program execution.

## Logical Data Structures
These define **how data can be utilized** and **how operations are performed on it**.

## DSA Definition
Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) is the way we **organize and arrange data in main memory** so that programs can access and manipulate it efficiently.

## CPU Interaction
- Data + Program Code → Loaded in memory  
- Program performs operations on the data  
- Efficient arrangement → faster and optimized execution
