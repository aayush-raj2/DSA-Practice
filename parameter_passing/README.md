# ðŸ”¹ Parameter Passing in Functions  

This folder demonstrates different **parameter passing mechanisms** in C and C++.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Programs Included  
1. **Pass by Value (C)** â€“ Does not modify original values.  
2. **Call by Address (C)** â€“ Uses pointers to modify actual parameters.  
3. **Call by Reference (C++)** â€“ Uses references to modify values (C++ only).  
4. **Arrays as Parameters (C)** â€“ Demonstrates passing arrays (always by address).  

---

## âœ… Key Points  
- **Pass by Value** â†’ Function gets a copy â†’ changes donâ€™t affect original values.  
- **Call by Address** â†’ Function gets memory addresses â†’ changes reflect in caller.  
- **Call by Reference** â†’ C++ feature â†’ references act as aliases (simpler than pointers).  
- **Arrays as Parameters** â†’ Arrays in C are **always passed by address** (like pointers).

## ðŸ“Š Example Outputs  
- **Pass by Value:**  
Before swap: a=10, b=20
After swap (Pass by Value): a=10, b=20


- **Call by Address:**  
Before swap: a=10, b=20
After swap (Call by Address): a=20, b=10


- **Call by Reference (C++):**  
Before swap: a=10, b=20
After swap (Call by Reference): a=20, b=10


- **Arrays as Parameters:**  
Array elements: 2 4 6 8 10

## ðŸš€ How to Run  
```bash
# Pass by Value
gcc pass_by_value.c -o value
./value

# Call by Address
gcc call_by_address.c -o address
./address

# Arrays as Parameters
gcc arrays_as_parameters.c -o arrays
./arrays

# Call by Reference (C++ only)
g++ call_by_reference.cpp -o reference
./reference
