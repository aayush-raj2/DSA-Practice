# ðŸ”¹ Parameter Passing in Functions  

This folder demonstrates different **parameter passing mechanisms** in C and C++.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Programs Included  
1. **Pass by Value (C)** â€“ Does not modify original values.  
2. **Call by Address (C)** â€“ Uses pointers to modify actual parameters.  
3. **Call by Reference (C++)** â€“ Uses references to modify values (C++ only).  
4. **Arrays as Parameters (C)** â€“ Demonstrates passing arrays (always by address).  
5. **Structures as Parameters (C/C++)** â€“ Passing user-defined types (by value, address, or reference).

---

## âœ… Key Points  
- **Pass by Value** â†’ Function gets a copy â†’ changes donâ€™t affect original values.  
- **Call by Address** â†’ Function gets memory addresses â†’ changes reflect in caller.  
- **Call by Reference** â†’ C++ feature â†’ references act as aliases (simpler than pointers).  
- **Arrays as Parameters** â†’ Arrays in C are **always passed by address** (like pointers).  
- **Structures as Parameters** â†’ Can be passed *by value*, *by address*, or *by reference (C++)*.

## ðŸ“Š Example Outputs  
- **Pass by Value:**  
Before swap: a=10, b=20
After swap (Pass by Value): a=10, b=20


- **Call by Address:**  
Before swap: a=10, b=20
After swap (Call by Address): a=20, b=10


- **Call by Reference (C++):**  
Before swap: a=10, b=20
After swap (Call by Reference): a=20, b=10


- **Arrays as Parameters:**  
Array elements: 2 4 6 8 10


**Structures as Parameters:**
Area (by value): 50
Updated Length: 20
