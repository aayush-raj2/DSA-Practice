## How to Use
1. Browse folders by topic.  
2. Open files for code or notes.  
3. Each file is named with the **date and topic**, e.g., `2025-09-10_Array_Basics.md`.

## Daily Plan
- Study **1 topic per day**.  
- Create a new file for that topic with the **date prefix**.  
- Commit and push to GitHub → keeps your **contribution streak visible**.
